# CanvEngine
Game engine using CPU-based rendering on **Swing**'s `JPanel`.

## Etymology
In "Canv-Engine" the "Canv" stands for "Canvas", that is because `JPanel` serves the role of "Canvas" in graphics rendering.

## Examples of usage
In the `examples` submodule **you can find some games and simulations** made using this engine.  
There is a notable **`plain_tanks`** game that is **not fully using CanvEngine** as it was only partially-ported from my first (integrated) Java game engine to *CanvEngine*. I only found time to make *Plain Tanks* use CanvEngine's asset server instead of the old one that really didn't have a good support for caching sounds.
